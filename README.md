# 🐝 Bee Simulation Project

A visual and interactive simulation that models the behavior of bees in a hive-based ecosystem. This project showcases worker bees exploring terrain, collecting nectar from flowers, avoiding obstacles, and returning resources to the hive — all in a dynamic, animated environment using Python and Matplotlib.

## 🚀 Features

- Worker, Drone, and Queen bee roles simulated
- Realistic nectar collection and energy/rest cycles
- Smart terrain interaction with flowers, trees, water, animals
- Animated real-time visualization with bee paths and hive activity
- Extensible and readable code structure for educational use
