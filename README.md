# 🐝 Bee Simulation Project

A visual and interactive simulation that models the behavior of bees in a hive-based ecosystem. This project showcases worker bees exploring terrain, collecting nectar from flowers, avoiding obstacles, and returning resources to the hive — all in a dynamic, animated environment using Python and Matplotlib.
